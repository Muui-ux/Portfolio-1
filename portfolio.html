    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hello! I'm Margaret — a beginner web developer with a background in health but a lifelong passion for technology. While my academic and professional journey started in the health field, I’ve always been drawn to how tech can solve real-world problems and improve lives. I recently began learning web development, starting with HTML and CSS, and I’m excited to build useful, user-friendly websites from the ground up. This portfolio is my first step into the world of software development, and I’m looking forward to growing my skills and eventually working on meaningful tech projects that make a difference.</p>

  <h2>Interests</h2>

  <p>What excites me most about software development is its constantly evolving nature. I find real thrill in the fact that the tech world never stands still, there is always a new framework, tool, or idea around the corner. This continuous change pushes me to stay curious, keep learning, and embrace challenges with an open mind.</p>
  <p>I am currently working toward becoming a well-rounded developer, with a solid understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies. My goal is to be flexible and adaptable in this fast-paced industry, so I can contribute meaningfully in different areas of development. Looking ahead, I am particularly drawn to the field of Artificial Intelligence and hope to specialize in AI-driven solutions within software development as I grow in my journey.</p>
